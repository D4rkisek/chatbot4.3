Do I need car insurance?
If you own or drive a car, you’re legally required to have car insurance in the UK. Unless you officially register your car as off the road with a SORN, or if you’re in the process of buying or selling it, you could face a fine for not having insurance. 

What are the different types of car insurance?
* Third party 
* Third party fire and theft 
* Comprehensive car insurance.  
To make car insurance comparison easier, here's a quick rundown of what each level includes: 
Third party
This is the minimum level of insurance required by law. If you're involved in an accident, it covers damage to the other person's property, but costs to repair or replace your car will come from your pocket. And you won't be covered if your car is stolen or damaged by fire. 
Third party fire and theft
Third party fire and theft cover offers the same cover as a third-party policy but you're also covered if your car's stolen or damaged/destroyed by fire. 
Comprehensive
This provides you with the highest level of cover. If you're involved in an accident, the policy will pay out for costs associated with you and the third party. It also offers protection against fire and theft. 
People assume that third-party policies are the cheapest but, because more people claim on this type of insurance, they can cost just as much as – or sometimes more than – comprehensive policies. Even if comprehensive cover is a little more expensive, you benefit from a far greater level of protection on the road. 
There are also specialist insurance policies to suit different drivers, like: 
Multi Car cover 
YouDrive telematics insurance 
Business car policies 
What features can I get with my car insurance?

* Uninsured driver promise, which safeguards you if you’re involved in a non-fault accident with an uninsured driver.

* Four levels of optional breakdown cover, from basic roadside assistance to cover at home and in Europe. 
* Car key protection in case you damage, lose or have your car keys stolen.

* Enhanced personal accident cover to offer financial compensation for you and up to six passengers if you suffer injuries.

How much does car insurance cost?
There's no set price for car insurance. This is because car insurance companies calculate premiums based on a range of factors unique to you. These include: 
* Age and years of driving experience – younger, less experienced drivers usually cost more to insure as they’re seen as higher-risk. 
* Your driving history (claims and points, etc.). 
* Postcode, with cars kept in high-crime areas usually costlier to insure. 
* Where you keep your car during the day and night, for example in a garage or on the street. 
* Occupation – some jobs are seen as riskier if they involve lots of driving, for example. 
* Annual mileage – the longer that you spend on the road, the higher the risk of accidents. 
The car you drive also plays a big part in the price of cover, with car insurance companies taking into account: 
* Value 
* Modifications 
* Performance 
* Safety features 
How to get cheaper car insurance quotes
As well as comparing car insurance quotes for our different policies, there are many things that you can do to make sure that you pay the lowest possible price.  
Build a no claims discount by driving carefully and avoiding making claims for one year or more (though we still offer competitive car insurance for new drivers). 
Consider telematics insurance, which tracks and rewards sensible driving through a device fitted to your car. 
Improve your car’s security by storing it somewhere safe overnight and fitting approved extras like an alarm or immobiliser. 
Pay for insurance annually rather than monthly if you can afford to, as monthly payments include interest. 
Increase your voluntary excess (as long as you can still afford to pay it if you need to).

If you're on the hunt for budget car insurance and haven't yet bought your car, we recommend spending some time looking around for cheap cars to insure. All cars are grouped into one of 50 different insurance classes, with the cheapest cars in group 1. So, if you want to save on cover, your best bet is to choose a car in a lower group. See your chosen car’s insurance group by using Thatcham Research’s My Vehicle Search tool.

Yes, simply log in to our app or MyAccount and:
