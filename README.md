## Inspiration - Our team decided that we were the right people for the issue that the Hastings Direct team had.

## What it does - A web chatbot that assists customers with help finding the right insurance and navigating around the website, it also has a loading game that the customer can play when they are waiting to be connected to an agent. 

## How we built it - Python, Flask, Open AI, API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Challenges we ran into - Dependencies in VS Code- getting the correct Python interpreter for the code to run. Integrating the Pygame game into the flask web app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of - Connecting OpenAI's API 4.0 with the chatbot and creating a small game that links to the insurance company.

## What we learned - Software development, using Flask in general, integrating different applications together.

## What's next for Web Chat for Hastings Direct - Polishing UI and carrying out more testing.
